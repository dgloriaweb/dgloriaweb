### Hello, You!

### About me:
I'm a self-taught php developer with 20 years executive assistant and office management background. I felt what I did as administrator, didn't exploit my talents and my curiosity always carried me towards problem solving. I wrote my first code at age 13, on a Commodore VC20, (or plus4, can't remember) where I used a for loop to paint the screen red. It was mesmerising. I started to work full time as a dev in 2018, and kept learning new tech. Now I am updating my knowledge in Laravel 7, but keep an eye on Javascript frameworks as well. I've got 4-5 projects in my cupboard waiting to be born, and come up with new ones every now and then. I currently work as a freelancer, and start my new job in the UK in September 2020.
