### Hello, You! Meet me!

### About me:
I'm a self-taught php developer with 20 years' executive assistant and office management background. I felt, my job as an administrator didn't exploit my talents, and my curiosity always carried me towards problem solving. I wrote my first code at age 13, on a Commodore VC20, (or plus4, can't remember) in BASIC, I used a for loop to paint the screen red. It was mesmerising. I started to work full time as a PHP dev in 2018, however I first met PHP in 2006 and since he was cheap and easy to handle, it was love at first site. However I hate frameworks, currently I am updating my knowledge in Laravel 7, but keep an eye on Javascript frameworks, see how it goes. I've got 4-5 projects in my cupboard waiting to be born, and come up with new ones every now and then. I currently work as a freelancer, and start my new job in the UK in September 2020.

### Strengths:

Working side by side with CEO and other managers provided experience in corporate level decisions, interpretation of business requirements to IT team and vica verse, hardware troubleshooting, root cause analysis, finding recurring processeses, advise in replacing those with IT solutions to eliminate errors, see through internal processes, using IT tools to simplify time consuming tasks such as inventory,  document handling, repetitive tasks, data management, reporting, HR tasks, and the list of the things you can learn just by observing goes on forever.
